***ScaRLib*** (**Sca**la **R**einforcement **L**earning **L**ibrary) is a Scala-based framework for cooperative many agents reinforcement learning (CMARL).

The aim of this project is to develop a tool that relies on state-of-the-art deep learning libraries to support the definition of CMARL systems in JVM-based environments.
Moreover, ScaRLib integrates [ScaFi] programming framework and [Alchemist] simulator to enable learning of field-based coordination policies for large-scale systems.
